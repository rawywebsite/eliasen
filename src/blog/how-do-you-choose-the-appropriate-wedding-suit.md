Questions:

1- How to choose the right suit style

2-How to choose the material of the suit

3-How to choose the color of the suit

\===========================

My friend, the first thing you need to do is answer all these questions

How is it?

I tell you now, when you come to choose the style of the suit, you must first determine which one is suitable

I mean, if your brother, for example, you will wear a soiree suit like this

Of course, every style has its own occasion

Ok, Elias, how can I choose the material and color?

For the color you choose if your fianc√©e brings a dress you have to match the dress!

you need the color to choose according to the occasion, day or nigh

For during the day, light colors like this

For and at night, darker colors are preferred like this

How do I choose the raw material, Elias?

I like your question because it is very important

The first thing, according to us, is in the summer

We wear light colors and it is possible to keep a light material like the Egyptian Ford or a lot of Turkish materials

A and in the winter

You have many options, such as cotton wool, processed wool, and chia seeds

And according to us at night or during the day, and of course the last thing according to your budget..
